      <h2>The Five Basic Tastes</h2>
      <p>The human palate can detect five primary tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. These tastes are perceived by specialized receptors on our taste buds, each located in different areas of the tongue.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sweet</strong>: Associated with sugars, fruits, and some carbohydrates.</li>
        <li><strong>Sour</strong>: Associated with acids, such as citrus fruits and vinegar.</li>
        <li><strong>Salty</strong>: Associated with sodium chloride, or table salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Bitter</strong>: Associated with alkaloids found in some plants and coffee.</li>
        <li><strong>Umami</strong>: Associated with glutamate, found in meats, cheeses, and tomatoes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Art of Flavor Harmonies</h2>
      <p>Creating harmonious flavor combinations is a delicate art that involves balancing the five basic tastes and using complementary ingredients. Chefs often employ the concept of flavor profiles, which categorize ingredients based on their dominant tastes.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complementary Flavors</strong>: Ingredients that enhance each other's flavors, such as sweet and sour, or salty and umami.</li>
        <li><strong>Contrasting Flavors</strong>: Ingredients that create a contrast in flavors, such as sweet and bitter, or salty and sweet.</li>
        <li><strong>Acidity</strong>: Acidic ingredients, such as citrus fruits and vinegar, can brighten flavors and cut through richness.</li>
        <li><strong>Fat</strong>: Fat, such as butter and oil, can carry and enhance flavors, adding richness and mouthfeel.</li>
        <li><strong>Herbs and Spices</strong>: Herbs and spices provide a vast array of flavors and aromas, adding complexity and depth to dishes.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="cultural-influences">
      <h2>Cultural Influences on Flavor Preferences</h2>
      <p>Culinary traditions around the world have developed unique flavor profiles based on local ingredients, cooking techniques, and cultural preferences. Understanding these cultural influences can broaden our culinary horizons and inspire new flavor creations.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Asian Cuisine</strong>: Emphasis on umami, balance, and fresh ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Mediterranean Cuisine</strong>: Use of olive oil, fresh herbs, and acidic ingredients.</li>
